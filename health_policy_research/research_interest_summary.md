My research is focused on developing and implementing a computationally-driven management framework to address systemic failures in mental healthcare. I apply theories from operations management and organizational economics to design and validate new models of care delivery, with a specific interest in creating patient-centered payment models and technology-enabled workflows for acute psychiatric settings. My work aims to bridge the gap between technological innovation and its effective, equitable implementation in real-world clinical practice.
