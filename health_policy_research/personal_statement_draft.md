# Forged in Failure: A Blueprint for a New Psychiatry

My journey into the world of mental health did not begin in a classroom or a lab. It began in the quiet wreckage of my own life. In 2020, after years of striving, the future I had been building collapsed. A $1,500 financial hold at my community college had blocked my graduation and transfer, which led to the loss of my F1 student visa and, with it, my legal status in the United States. This administrative hurdle cost me internship offers from top financial institutions and a promising career in cybersecurity. It was a devastating derailment, compounded by the prolonged illness of my father back home—a battle that had already consumed my family's resources—and his eventual passing, followed closely by the loss of my grandmother. Last year, the final supports gave way: I was laid off from my job, evicted from my home, and, after a period of homelessness sleeping in my car, I lost that too.

In the midst of this profound loss and systemic failure, something unexpected happened. I felt a surprising and deep sense of calm. It was a resilience I did not know I possessed, and it sparked a question that has defined my life ever since: How was I coping? And more broadly, why do we, as a society, have so few objective, scientific answers for how the human mind functions under such immense, prolonged stress? That question became my mission.

I realized that to find an answer, I couldn't remain on the outside. I had to immerse myself in the very system I sought to understand. I systematically retrained, earning certifications as a Nursing Assistant and a Direct Support Professional, which led me to my current role as a mental health worker in an acute psychiatric hospital. On the front lines, I saw the theoretical problems of healthcare in stark, human terms. I witnessed the "trial-and-error" nature of psychiatric treatment, the crushing administrative burden on clinicians, and the daily reality of patients suffering from a system not equipped to handle their complexity.

This clinical exposure, combined with my technical background in computer science, led to the synthesis of my work: **Project Jatoria**. It is not a side project, but my self-directed, multi-year research initiative into computational psychiatry. It is my answer to the inefficiencies I witness every day. Project Jatoria is designed to build the data-driven tools that I know are missing from the clinical toolkit—tools that can identify objective biological and behavioral markers, move beyond subjective reporting, and ultimately help create more precise, personalized treatment plans.

The path that brought me here was not the one I would have chosen, but it has forged a better, more qualified version of myself. The loss of my student visa and the subsequent years without legal status forced me to become a different kind of builder. I started my own software studio, consulting for international clients from the U.S., honing my technical and entrepreneurial skills under the most challenging of circumstances. Today, I am rebuilding my academic foundation with a strategic focus that no traditional degree path could offer. I am finishing my associate's degree, correcting the grades that faltered during my family's crisis, and then transferring to UMGC. There, I am pursuing not just a single major, but a bespoke curriculum: a Bachelor's in Cyber Operations, fortified with certificates in Health Information Management, Data Analysis, and Management. In parallel, I am enrolled at Cypress College to become a licensed Psychiatric Technician, deepening my clinical credentials.

This unique, "forged in failure" path has given me the exact combination of skills I need to pursue my ultimate vision: to become a physician-scientist and a leader in health policy. I do not just have a theoretical interest in the "Social Determinants of Health"; I have lived them. I understand, from personal experience, how a small administrative barrier can derail a life, and how crucial it is to build systems that are not only technologically advanced but also humane, equitable, and resilient. My goal is to use my PhD to formalize this understanding, to develop the rigorous, evidence-based methodologies needed to take the tools from Project Jatoria and scale them into solutions that can reshape our broken system. I am not the applicant I thought I would be ten years ago. I am a more resilient, more focused, and more deeply motivated one, uniquely equipped to build the future of mental healthcare.
