# Health Policy PhD: Management Concentration Research Plan

## Introduction

My research interests are situated at the intersection of **healthcare management, technology, and mental health policy**. My unique background, combining a technical foundation in computer science with frontline clinical experience in an acute psychiatric hospital, provides me with a distinct perspective on the systemic failures and opportunities within our healthcare system. The following research pillars represent the core areas I intend to explore during my PhD studies, with the ultimate goal of designing and implementing more efficient, equitable, and data-driven systems of care.

### Area 1: Operations Management and Delivery Process Redesign

This area applies operations management concepts (like Lean, Six Sigma, and PDSA) to improve the efficiency and quality of psychiatric care, using my computational skills to analyze complex clinical workflows.

*   **A. AI-Driven Optimization of Acute Psychiatric Workflows:** Designing efficient, evidence-based care delivery processes by eliminating administrative burden and staff waste. Researching how Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and LLM models can streamline documentation and generate customized, function-based assessments (FBA) for staff training and intervention plans addresses critical organizational inefficiency.
*   **B. Improving Throughput and Capacity Management in Crisis Care:** Strategically managing acute inpatient capacity (e.g., WIC 5150/5250 units) to reduce patient "stranding" and improve transitions to less restrictive settings. The research would involve applying predictive analytics to claims and clinical data to forecast optimal discharge readiness, thereby helping hospital administrators redesignate patient areas based on readiness and manage facility capacity more effectively.
*   **C. Organizational Management for Restraint and Seclusion Elimination:** Implementing and evaluating organizational behavior and quality improvement managerial strategies necessary to eliminate highly restrictive interventions (restraint/seclusion), aligning operations with regulatory standards. Research would evaluate the managerial cost-benefit of investing in enhanced staff training and continuous process monitoring (PDSA cycle) versus the downstream costs of restraint use and poor outcomes.

### Area 2: Financial Incentives and Organizational Economics

This area focuses on applying organizational economics and payment reform strategy to mental health, addressing the systemic financial flaws identified in the sources.

*   **D. Redesigning Payment Models for Computational Psychiatric Care:** Creating financially viable Patient-Centered Payment (PCP) models that adequately reimburse providers for delivering high-quality, continuous, technology-enabled mental health care.
*   **E. Market Impact of Mental Health Price and Transparency Data:** Analyzing whether health plan price transparency efforts improve market competition and influence consumer choice/negotiation for psychiatric services.
*   **F. Financial Solvency and Resource Allocation in Rural Behavioral Health:** Evaluating the effectiveness and strategic allocation of government funds designed to transform rural delivery systems, specifically focusing on mental health infrastructure and access.

### Area 3: Technology Adoption and Regulatory Strategy

This area focuses on the development and adoption of new medical technologies and the necessary management of professional health care staffs to utilize them.

*   **G. Strategic Adoption and Usability of AI/LLMs in Psychiatry:** Investigating the organizational and human factors (usability) that impact physician adoption of LLMs and decision support tools in acute care.
*   **H. Regulatory Strategy and Competitive Positioning for Digital Devices:** Analyzing the strategic path (competitive strategy) for building and scaling FDA-approved combination products, assessing how regulatory programs like Breakthrough Devices expedite market entry.
*   **I. Managing Administrative Waste through AI Policy:** Quantifying the true administrative cost of payer claim complexity (Utilization Management) and studying the effectiveness of technology interventions (e.g., AI/RPA in PA) on the productivity of professional staff.

### Area 4: Organizational Structure, Equity, and the Patient-Consumer Role

This area applies organizational structure and health equity research to the delivery of mental health services, framing the patient's experience as a critical management concern.

*   **J. Organizational Health Literacy and Management of Complex Regulations:** Assessing and improving organizational health literacy in mental health organizations to enable patients (consumers) to understand complex involuntary commitment laws and treatment plans.
*   **K. Management of Conservatorship and Unrepresented Patients:** Analyzing the organizational structure and managerial policies hospitals use for making treatment decisions for unrepresented, incapacitated patients who lack a surrogate decision maker, especially in acute psychiatric settings.
*   **L. Managing Professional Staffing and Training in Behavioral Health:** Studying innovative managerial approaches to address the extreme mental health workforce shortage and improve staff retention and training quality in high-stress acute care environments.
