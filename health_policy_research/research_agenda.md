# Research Agenda: Health Policy & Management

## Introduction

My research interests are situated at the intersection of **healthcare management, technology, and mental health policy**. My unique background, combining a technical foundation in computer science with frontline clinical experience in an acute psychiatric hospital, provides me with a distinct perspective on the systemic failures and opportunities within our healthcare system. The following research pillars represent the core areas I intend to explore during my PhD studies, with the ultimate goal of designing and implementing more efficient, equitable, and data-driven systems of care.

### 1. Organizational Design and Process Improvement in Healthcare Delivery

This area of focus examines the organizational, managerial, and strategic issues facing healthcare providers. My research will apply principles from operations management and organizational behavior to address critical process failures I have observed directly in the acute psychiatric setting.

**Key Research Questions:**

*   **Transition Planning & Patient Flow:** How can we design and implement efficient transition plans, beginning at intake, to prevent patients from becoming "stuck" in restrictive settings and improve patient flow through the care continuum?
*   **Therapeutic Environment Design:** What is the measurable impact of redesigning physical hospital environments to be less institutional and more conducive to patient recovery and autonomy?
*   **Workforce Management & Safety:** What are the most effective managerial strategies and training programs (e.g., function-based assessment, de-escalation) to ensure staff can safely manage acute behavioral crises while adhering to strict regulations on restraint and seclusion?

### 2. Healthcare Quality, Productivity, and Value

This pillar focuses on applying competitive strategy and operational efficiency to improve both the quality and value of healthcare. My research will aim to move beyond traditional metrics to redefine what constitutes "value" in healthcare.

**Key Research Questions:**

*   **Defining and Measuring Quality:** How can we develop and implement better quality metrics that are patient-centered, equitable, and effectively measure safety, timeliness, and efficacy, particularly in under-resourced settings?
*   **Reducing Administrative Waste:** What are the specific sources of administrative waste in psychiatric hospitals that contribute most to physician burnout and low productivity, and what Lean management interventions (e.g., Value Stream Mapping) are most effective at eliminating them?
*   **The ROI of Organizational Health Literacy:** What is the quantifiable return on investment for organizations that invest in improving their "Organizational Health Literacy" to advance health equity and improve community health outcomes?

### 3. Financial Incentives, Organizational Economics, and Market Structure

This research area investigates how financial incentives and market structure drive the behavior of providers and payers. My work will focus on critiquing current payment models and exploring alternatives that better support integrated and high-quality care.

**Key Research Questions:**

*   **Patient-Centered Payment Models:** How can we design and implement "Patient-Centered Payment" models that reward the delivery of appropriate, evidence-based care for each individual, rather than penalizing providers who treat higher-need patients?
*   **Financing Integrated Behavioral Health:** What novel, value-based payment models can be structured to adequately finance and sustain the integration of behavioral health services within primary care settings?
*   **Market Concentration and Competition:** How does market concentration, as measured by tools like the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), impact the cost, quality, and accessibility of mental healthcare in specific regions, and what policy interventions can foster a more competitive environment?

### 4. Development, Adoption, and Management of New Medical Technologies

This pillar leverages my background in computer science to study the strategic implementation and impact of technology in clinical settings. My research will focus on bridging the gap between technological potential and practical, effective implementation.

**Key Research Questions:**

*   **EHR Usability and ROI:** What are the key "human factors" and workflow integration challenges that lead to low physician satisfaction and poor ROI for Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems, and how can they be redesigned for better clinical utility?
*   **AI in Clinical Decision Support:** How can we effectively design, validate, and implement AI-driven Clinical Decision Support (CDS) tools that are trusted by clinicians and demonstrably improve diagnostic accuracy and adherence to evidence-based guidelines?
*   **Policy and Technology Co-evolution:** How must healthcare policy (e.g., licensing, reimbursement, privacy regulations) evolve to support the sustained and equitable use of emerging technologies like telehealth and AI-driven diagnostic tools, ensuring they reduce, rather than exacerbate, health disparities?
