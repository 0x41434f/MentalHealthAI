# PhD Research Prospectus: Health Policy & Management

## 1. The Health Policy Problem

The American mental healthcare system is failing. It is a byzantine web of stakeholders characterized by immense financial, administrative, and regulatory complexity. This system is not only inefficient, costing U.S. employers over $575 billion annually in lost productivity due to poor worker health, but it is also structurally incapable of delivering timely, effective, or equitable care. My frontline experience as a mental health worker in an acute psychiatric hospital has provided a ground-level view of this crisis: a system that defaults to "trial-and-error" treatment, creates immense administrative waste that burns out clinicians, and ultimately fails the complex patients it is meant to serve. This is the critical health policy problem my research will address.

## 2. The Importance of Solving This Problem

The urgency to solve this problem is twofold. First, the human cost is staggering. The current system's inability to provide precise, early interventions leads to preventable suffering, cycles of hospitalization, and tragic outcomes. Second, the system is on a collision course with profound societal instability. The rise of AI and automation will likely lead to increased economic precarity, which will, in turn, ignite a massive surge in demand for mental health services. A system that is already failing will utterly collapse under this future pressure, making the need for a redesigned, more resilient infrastructure a national imperative.

## 3. Previous Research & Existing Approaches

Previous attempts to solve these issues have been incremental and have largely failed to address the root causes.
*   **Payment Models:** Traditional Fee-for-Service (FFS) models incentivize volume over value, while first-generation Value-Based Payment (VBP) models like Pay-for-Performance (P4P) and Shared Savings are often payer-centric, failing to adequately finance the complex, integrated care required for behavioral health.
*   **Technology:** Health Information Technology (HIT), particularly Electronic Health Records (EHRs), was intended to improve efficiency and quality. However, the market is highly concentrated, and most physicians report that EHRs, due to their poor usability and lack of interoperability, actually hinder their workflow.
*   **Operations:** Quality improvement methodologies like Lean and Six Sigma have been applied, but often in a piecemeal fashion that does not address the fundamental organizational design flaws of care delivery.

## 4. The Limitations of These Approaches

The core limitation of these existing approaches is their failure to integrate. Payment models are disconnected from the operational realities of care, technology is not designed to support clinical workflows, and quality improvement is attempted without the data needed to truly measure what matters. They are siloed solutions applied to a deeply interconnected problem. Crucially, they lack a mechanism to incorporate objective, patient-specific biological and behavioral data into the management and financial frameworks of care.

## 5. My Core Hypothesis

My central hypothesis is that **by creating a computationally-driven management framework that integrates objective, patient-specific data (from Project Jatoria) with evidence-based operational processes and patient-centered payment models, we can achieve superior clinical and financial outcomes.** I predict that this integrated approach will resolve the core problems by enabling providers to deliver personalized, evidence-based care, while creating a financial model that sustainably rewards high-value treatment for the most complex patients.

## 6. Detailed Research Plan

My PhD research will be structured as a multi-stage program designed to build and validate this new framework. It is organized into three interconnected workstreams that leverage theories from **operations management, organizational economics, and technology adoption**:

**Workstream 1: Technology Development & Validation (Project Jatoria)**
This workstream focuses on the core enabling technology.
*   **(G) Strategic Adoption and Usability of AI/LLMs in Psychiatry:** Investigating the organizational and human factors that impact physician adoption of LLMs and decision support tools.
*   **(H) Regulatory Strategy for Digital Devices:** Analyzing the strategic path for building and scaling FDA-approved combination products (computational tools + interventions).
*   **(I) Managing Administrative Waste through AI Policy:** Quantifying the administrative cost of payer complexity and studying the effectiveness of AI/RPA in automating administrative tasks.

**Workstream 2: Operations Management & Process Improvement**
This workstream studies the real-world implementation of these tools to improve hospital workflows.
*   **(A) AI-Driven Optimization of Acute Psychiatric Workflows:** Designing and testing evidence-based care delivery processes that use AI to reduce administrative burden.
*   **(B) Improving Throughput and Capacity Management:** Applying predictive analytics to clinical data to forecast optimal discharge readiness and improve patient flow.
*   **(C) Organizational Management for Restraint and Seclusion Elimination:** Evaluating the cost-benefit of investing in enhanced, data-driven staff training to eliminate the use of highly restrictive interventions.

**Workstream 3: Organizational Economics & Payment Model Redesign**
This workstream designs and tests the novel payment models required to finance this new system of care.
*   **(D) Redesigning Payment Models for Computational Psychiatric Care:** Creating and simulating financially viable Patient-Centered Payment (PCP) models that reimburse providers for high-quality, technology-enabled care.
*   **(E) Market Impact of Mental Health Price Transparency:** Analyzing whether price transparency efforts improve market competition for technology-enabled psychiatric services.
*   **(F) Financing Integrated Behavioral Health:** Designing novel, value-based payment models structured to adequately finance and sustain the integration of behavioral health services within primary care.

## 7. Evaluation of Research Outcomes

I will show that this research resolves the identified problems through a multi-faceted evaluation approach. For the technology, success will be measured by the predictive accuracy of the models and their usability ratings from clinicians. For the operations, success will be measured by improvements in key performance indicators like patient length-of-stay, staff time spent on administrative tasks, and rates of restraint/seclusion. For the economics, success will be measured by the financial viability of the proposed payment models in simulation and their ability to incentivize high-value care.

## 8. Proposed Timeline

I anticipate completing this research over a four-year timeline.
*   **Year 1:** Coursework, First-Year Tutorial, and development of the core Project Jatoria models.
*   **Year 2:** Second-year paper focusing on the results of Workstream 1; begin data collection for Workstream 2.
*   **Year 3:** Thesis proposal defense; complete Workstream 2 analysis and begin simulations for Workstream 3.
*   **Year 4:** Dissertation completion, writing, and defense.

## 9. Potential Contributions to the Health Policy Community

This research will make several key contributions. It will provide a **novel, integrated framework** for addressing the mental health crisis that connects technology, operations, and policy. It will offer **empirical evidence** on the effectiveness of AI-driven tools in a real-world clinical setting. Finally, it will deliver **actionable, evidence-based policy recommendations** for designing and financing a 21st-century mental healthcare system. This work is designed to produce not just academic publications, but a practical blueprint for building the future of mental healthcare.
