# PhD Research Prospectus: Health Policy & Management

## 1. The Health Policy Problem

The American mental healthcare system is failing. It is a byzantine web of stakeholders characterized by immense financial, administrative, and regulatory complexity. This system is not only catastrophically inefficient, with U.S. hospitals spending nearly twice as much on administration ($687B) as on direct patient care ($346B), but it is also structurally incapable of delivering timely, effective, or equitable care. My frontline experience as a mental health worker in an acute psychiatric hospital has provided a ground-level view of this crisis: a system that defaults to "trial-and-error" treatment, creates immense administrative waste that burns out clinicians, and ultimately fails the complex patients it is meant to serve. This is the critical health policy problem my research will address.

## 2. The Importance of Solving This Problem

The urgency to solve this problem is twofold. First, the human cost is staggering. Nearly one in five U.S. adults reports anxiety or depression, yet only 13.4% receive therapy, with the majority citing cost and lack of provider access as primary barriers. Second, the system is on a collision course with profound societal instability. The rise of AI and automation will likely lead to increased economic precarity, which will, in turn, ignite a massive surge in demand for mental health services. A system that is already failing will utterly collapse under this future pressure, making the need for a redesigned, more resilient infrastructure a national imperative.

## 3. Previous Research & Existing Approaches

Previous attempts to solve these issues have been incremental and have largely failed to address the root causes.
*   **Payment Models:** Traditional Fee-for-Service (FFS) models incentivize volume over value, while first-generation Value-Based Payment (VBP) models like Pay-for-Performance (P4P) and Shared Savings are often payer-centric, failing to adequately finance the complex, integrated care required for behavioral health.
*   **Technology:** Health Information Technology (HIT), particularly Electronic Health Records (EHRs), was intended to improve efficiency and quality. However, the market is highly concentrated, and most physicians report that EHRs, due to their poor usability and lack of interoperability, actually hinder their workflow.
*   **Operations:** Quality improvement methodologies like Lean and Six Sigma have been applied, but often in a piecemeal fashion that does not address the fundamental organizational design flaws of care delivery.

## 4. The Limitations of These Approaches

The core limitation of these existing approaches is their failure to integrate. Payment models are disconnected from the operational realities of care, technology is not designed to support clinical workflows, and quality improvement is attempted without the data needed to truly measure what matters. They are siloed solutions applied to a deeply interconnected problem. Crucially, they lack a mechanism to incorporate objective, patient-specific biological and behavioral data into the management and financial frameworks of care.

## 5. My Core Hypothesis

My central hypothesis is that **by creating a computationally-driven management framework that integrates objective, patient-specific data (from Project Jatoria) with evidence-based operational processes and patient-centered payment models, we can achieve superior clinical and financial outcomes.** I predict that this integrated approach will resolve the core problems by enabling providers to deliver personalized, evidence-based care, while creating a financial model that sustainably rewards high-value treatment for the most complex patients.

## 6. Detailed Research Plan

My PhD research will be structured as a multi-stage program designed to build and validate this new framework. It is organized into interconnected workstreams that leverage theories from **operations management, organizational economics, and technology adoption**.

### Area 1: Operations Management and Delivery Process Redesign

**The Problem:** The U.S. has one of the smallest primary care workforces in the OECD, creating immense strain on downstream facilities. This strain manifests as operational failure. A 2025 Disability Rights California (DRC) investigation into an acute psychiatric hospital revealed a facility that accounted for over 25% of all restraint incidents in the state's vendor system, utilized "boilerplate language" instead of individualized behavioral plans, and failed to provide a therapeutic environment. This demonstrates a critical need for research into the core delivery processes of psychiatric care.

**Key Research Questions:**

*   **(A) AI-Driven Optimization of Acute Psychiatric Workflows:** How can AI and LLM models be used to move beyond "boilerplate" documentation and generate customized, function-based assessments (FBA) for staff training and intervention plans, addressing critical organizational inefficiencies?
*   **(B) Improving Throughput and Capacity Management in Crisis Care:** How can predictive analytics be applied to clinical and claims data to forecast optimal discharge readiness, helping administrators manage capacity and prevent patients from getting "stuck in a more restrictive setting"?
*   **(C) Organizational Management for Restraint and Seclusion Elimination:** What is the quantifiable cost-benefit of investing in enhanced, data-driven staff training and de-escalation techniques versus the immense downstream costs (clinical, financial, and legal) of over-reliance on restraint and seclusion?

### Area 2: Financial Incentives and Organizational Economics

**The Problem:** The U.S. healthcare market is notoriously inefficient, a fact underscored by the weak correlation (r=0.27) between hospital inpatient occupancy and operating profit margin. This inefficiency is particularly acute in mental health, where a DRC investigation found that California invested over $500 million in a jail-based program (EASS) with a competency restoration rate below 5%, while successful community-based programs showed re-incarceration rates of less than 1%. This highlights a profound misalignment of financial incentives and organizational strategy.

**Key Research Questions:**

*   **(D) Redesigning Payment Models for Computational Psychiatric Care:** How can Patient-Centered Payment (PCP) models be designed to adequately reimburse providers for delivering high-quality, continuous, and technology-enabled mental health care, especially for high-need populations?
*   **(E) Market Impact of Mental Health Price Transparency:** How can data from price transparency mandates be used to analyze the market for behavioral health services and empower payers to negotiate for higher-value care?
*   **(F) Financial Solvency and Resource Allocation in Rural Behavioral Health:** How can we evaluate the effectiveness of large-scale government investments in rural health to ensure funds are allocated to evidence-based community programs, not ineffective "half-measure" solutions?

---

### Area 3: Technology Adoption and Regulatory Strategy

**The Problem:** While technology holds promise, its implementation often fails. U.S. hospitals spend more on administration than on patient care, yet most physicians report that EHRs do not improve their workflow. Furthermore, the DRC reports illustrate a significant gap between regulatory requirements and on-the-ground practice, indicating a failure in both technology adoption and the management of professional staff.

**Key Research Questions:**

*   **(G) Strategic Adoption and Usability of AI/LLMs in Psychiatry:** What are the key organizational and "human factors" (usability) that impact physician and staff adoption of new AI-driven decision support tools in high-stress, acute care environments?
*   **(H) Regulatory Strategy for Digital Devices:** What is the optimal strategic and regulatory pathway for moving computational tools like Project Jatoria from a research concept to a scalable, FDA-approved "combination product"?
*   **(I) Managing Administrative Waste through AI Policy:** How can AI and RPA be used to quantify and mitigate the immense administrative burden of payer complexity (e.g., Prior Authorization), freeing up clinical resources and reducing staff burnout?

### Area 4: Organizational Structure, Equity, and the Patient-Consumer Role

**The Problem:** The U.S. faces a critical shortage of mental health providers, with 63% of adults citing inadequate supply as a barrier to care and 72.7% of counties designated as shortage areas. This scarcity places immense pressure on existing systems, where patients are often disempoweredâ€”subjected to non-individualized plans and housed in anti-therapeutic environments, as documented by the DRC. This points to a fundamental failure in organizational design and patient-centeredness.

**Key Research Questions:**

*   **(J) Organizational Health Literacy and Management of Complex Regulations:** How can organizations use technology (e.g., LLMs to simplify complex legal forms) to improve their "Organizational Health Literacy" and ensure patients can understand and participate in their own care?
*   **(K) Management of Conservatorship and Unrepresented Patients:** What are the best-practice organizational structures and managerial policies for making ethical and medically appropriate treatment decisions for unrepresented, incapacitated patients, ensuring equity and avoiding bias?
*   **(L) Managing the Behavioral Health Workforce Shortage:** What are the most effective managerial strategies and state-level policy interventions to address the critical workforce shortage and improve staff retention and training quality in acute care settings?

## 7. Evaluation of Research Outcomes

I will show that this research resolves the identified problems through a multi-faceted evaluation approach. For the technology, success will be measured by the predictive accuracy of the models and their usability ratings from clinicians. For the operations, success will be measured by improvements in key performance indicators like patient length-of-stay, staff time spent on administrative tasks, and rates of restraint/seclusion. For the economics, success will be measured by the financial viability of the proposed payment models in simulation and their ability to incentivize high-value care.

## 8. Proposed Timeline

I anticipate completing this research over a four-year timeline.
*   **Year 1:** Coursework, First-Year Tutorial, and development of the core Project Jatoria models.
*   **Year 2:** Second-year paper focusing on the results of Workstream 1; begin data collection for Workstream 2.
*   **Year 3:** Thesis proposal defense; complete Workstream 2 analysis and begin simulations for Workstream 3.
*   **Year 4:** Dissertation completion, writing, and defense.

## 9. Potential Contributions to the Health Policy Community

This research will make several key contributions. It will provide a **novel, integrated framework** for addressing the mental health crisis that connects technology, operations, and policy. It will offer **empirical evidence** on the effectiveness of AI-driven tools in a real-world clinical setting. Finally, it will deliver **actionable, evidence-based policy recommendations** for designing and financing a 21st-century mental healthcare system. This work is designed to produce not just academic publications, but a practical blueprint for building the future of mental healthcare.
