I am applying to the PhD Program in Health Policy at Harvard University with a dual concentration in Management and Methods for Policy Research. My goal is to become a physician-scientist equipped not only to develop novel computational tools for psychiatry but also to design, implement, and validate the new models of care delivery required to bring these innovations to patients. My background in computer science and my frontline clinical experience have given me a unique perspective on the systemic failures of our mental healthcare system, and I believe this specific dual concentration is the only path to gaining the rigorous, multi-disciplinary training needed to solve them.

My interest in health policy is the direct result of my work as a mental health worker in an acute psychiatric hospital. Through this long-term, observational "field research" across inpatient, emergency, and youth services, I have witnessed a system caught in a cycle of inefficiency. I have seen the immense administrative burden that leads to clinician burnout and the "trial-and-error" approach to treatment that fails patients with complex needs. This experience led me to create Project Jatoria, a self-directed research initiative to build the objective, data-driven tools that are desperately missing from clinical practice. My work on this project, which involves applying machine learning to identify biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis, represents my past and current research in computational psychiatry.

However, my clinical work has also shown me that technology alone is not a solution. A predictive algorithm is useless if the hospital's operational workflow cannot accommodate it, or if the financial incentives do not exist to pay for it. This realization has shaped my research ambitions, which are focused on the intersection of technology, operations, and economics. I am interested in how theories from **operations management** can be applied to redesign clinical workflows, how **organizational economics** can inform the creation of new patient-centered payment models, and how **competitive strategy** can guide the adoption of new medical technologies in a concentrated market.

Harvard is the ideal institution for this work because it is one of the only places where these distinct fields are studied as part of a single, integrated program. The ability to take courses at both the Harvard Business School and the Chan School of Public Health is critical for my research. I need to learn from faculty who are experts not just in health policy, but in the specific managerial disciplines required to translate a good idea into a sustainable, scalable system. The Field Research Requirement is also a perfect fit, as it would allow me to formalize the kind of real-world, organization-level investigation I am already conducting.

My career objective is to lead a research lab and an academic medical center division dedicated to computational psychiatry and health systems engineering. I aim to not only publish influential research in journals like JAMA and Nature but also to build and receive FDA approval for a new class of psychiatric devices that combine diagnostics and treatment. The training I would receive at Harvard is the essential next step in this journey. It will provide me with the theoretical framework, the methodological rigor, and the network of mentors needed to bridge the gap between my current research and my ultimate goal of redesigning our mental healthcare system from the ground up.
