My journey to a PhD in health policy began not in a classroom, but in the quiet wreckage of my own life. For months, I lived in a state of escalating fear as the future I had built collapsed. A $1,500 financial hold at my community college blocked my graduation, which led to the loss of my student visa and a promising career in cybersecurity. This administrative hurdle, compounded by the prolonged illness and eventual loss of my father and grandmother, set off a cascade of failures. I was laid off, became homeless, and watched as my car was repossessed.

In that moment of absolute collapse, the fear vanished. It was replaced by a profound and inexplicable sense of calm. My blood pressure, which I measured obsessively, never rose above 108/62, the lowest of my adult life. This paradox—intense external chaos met with internal stillness—became the central question of my life and the motivation for my graduate education. It forced me to confront the gap between the lived experience of human resilience and the clinical frameworks used to define mental distress.

These experiences have shaped me into the researcher I am today. I did not just endure these challenges; I learned to analyze them as systemic failures and to build my way out. While undocumented, I started my own software studio and consulted for international clients, honing my technical and entrepreneurial skills under extreme pressure. This experience taught me how to create value and solve problems when traditional pathways are closed. It is this perspective—the view from the ground up—that I will bring to the academic environment at Harvard. I have a firsthand understanding of how a small administrative barrier or a flaw in a system's design can have devastating, life-altering consequences.

I believe my unique journey will allow me to contribute to the Harvard community in a meaningful way. I can offer a perspective that is not just academic, but is deeply informed by the real-world friction of navigating broken systems. My background in both technology and frontline clinical care will allow me to serve as a bridge between different disciplines, connecting students from the Business School with the realities of public policy and clinical practice. The unconventional path that brought me here has forged a more resilient, more focused, and more deeply motivated scholar, one who is uniquely equipped to contribute to the urgent work of building a more humane and effective healthcare system.
