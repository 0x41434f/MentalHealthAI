# Health Policy & Management Research

This portfolio contains a collection of essays, analyses, and research focused on health policy and management. The work is dedicated to exploring the complex challenges within our healthcare system, with a particular emphasis on mental and behavioral health.

## Goal

The primary objective of this portfolio is to develop and demonstrate a deep understanding of the systemic issues that impact patient care and outcomes. Through rigorous analysis and writing, I aim to connect my firsthand clinical experience with broader policy and management theories.

This collection serves as a foundational part of my preparation for a PhD in Health Policy and Management, and ultimately, for a career dedicated to building more effective, equitable, and humane systems of care.
