# Project Jatoria

A roadmap to improve the understanding, prediction, and treatment of psychiatric illnesses.

## The Challenge in Modern Psychiatry

Unlike many other fields of medicine, psychiatry currently operates primarily on subjective information, relying heavily on patient self-reporting and clinical observation. There is a significant lack of objective, data-driven metrics to supplement this analysis. By integrating modern tools like neuroimaging, behavioral testing, and advanced algorithms, we can forge a direct link between the brain's mechanics and observable behavior. This would equip medical professionals with the crucial data needed to pinpoint root causes, refine diagnoses, and create tailored, more effective treatment strategies.

Furthermore, the field faces significant hurdles in its research methodologies. Many foundational statistical models and assumptions are inadequate. Designing studies with sufficient statistical power is often constrained by ethical considerations or practical impossibilities. Moreover, findings from animal models frequently fail to generalize to human conditions, and many diagnostic criteria carry unacknowledged cultural biases.

To move forward, we must anchor psychological concepts to tangible neural activity. This approach promises greater scientific rigor and reproducibility compared to relying solely on behavioral observation. The convergence of neuroscience and psychology is essential for progress, as human behavior is too complex to be captured by simple models alone. While both fields are advancing, there is still a vast frontier to explore before we can describe behavior with complete certainty.

## Goals

- Become extremely familiar with mental disorders by studying the DSM-5.
- Become extremely familiar with the biology of the brain and learn how to read neuroimaging datasets (e.g., EEG, fNIRS, and fMRI).
- Better understand brain structural and functional behavior by finding the molecular causes of psychiatric illnesses and mental disorders.
- Acquire multimodal datasets for various mental disorders.
- Use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms for the discovery of clinical, cognitive, and biological markers in mental health conditions.
- Build precision psychiatry tools for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic treatment prediction for psychiatric and neurologic disorders.
- Apply advanced statistical, AI, and ML techniques ethically to large Electronic Health Records (EHR), demographic, admission, drug prescription, and claims datasets of patients with mental disorders in my home country.

## Inspiration

- **ClearStrand-ASD:** The first and only objective laboratory test that can help healthcare providers rule out autism in children under 4 years (48 months) of age, using a strand of hair.
- **Eko Health:** Catches early signs of heart and lung disease during routine in-person and virtual physical exams through a digital stethoscope.

## Proof of Project

- Build LLM and multimodal foundation models that transform large Electronic Health Records (EHR), demographic, admission, drug prescription, and claims datasets of patients with mental disorders into meaningful insights at the point of care (~2 years).
- Publish papers in prestigious journals such as JAMA, Nature, and MICCAI.
- Build multiple FDA-approved devices for psychiatric care.

## Current Skills

- Proficient in Python and C++.
- Knowledgeable about PyTorch and TensorFlow.
- Clinical support experience in Intellectual Disability and Psychiatric Units in an acute hospital.
- Familiarity with mental health data types and psychiatric assessment tools (DSM-5).
- Strong research and writing skills, with experience reading academic papers.
- Experienced in building LLM applications, with the ability to fine-tune base models from providers like Google and Microsoft, despite limited GPU resources for pre-training from scratch.

## Skills to Acquire

- Master graph spectral theory and topological data analysis.
- Brush up on matrix algebra and frequency analysis.
- Learn the Geometry Scattering Trajectory Homology (GSTH) framework for neuroimaging data.
- Learn medical image analysis.

## Unique Insights from Experience

- Activities of daily living (ADLs) are a key factor in many of these challenges.
- Traditional 15-minute check-ins and 1:1 monitoring could potentially be replaced with remote monitoring to help prevent crises.
