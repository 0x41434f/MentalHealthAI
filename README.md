# Project Jatoria
A roadmap to improve the understanding, prediction, and treatment of psychiatric illnesses.

## The Problem
Psychiatry is one of the few medical specialties that relies on the patientâ€™s subjective reports and clinician observation alone, with little to no objective data to aid the subjective analysis. Linking brain mechanisms to behavior using algorithms, behavioral testing, and neuroimaging could arm clinicians with vital data to understand causes and to improve diagnosis, resulting in more personalized and effective treatment plans.

The statistics and assumptions underlying much of psychiatry are poor. Experiments needed to achieve the necessary power are either unethical or impossible. Realistic experiments on other species have the issue of not translating well, or at all, to humans. Many measurements and judgments are culturally specific, without being understood as such.

I believe that grounding certain psychological constructs or ideas in brain activity can instill more confidence than just observing behaviors and drawing conclusions that likely have reproducibility issues. The merging of psychology and brain sciences is the future, given that people are a lot more dynamic than an equation or model can account for. Frankly, psychology and neuroscience, while complementary, still have a long way to go in terms of describing behavior with full confidence.

## Goals
- Become extremely familiar with mental disorders by studying the DSM-5.
- Become extremely familiar with the biology of the brain and learn how to read neuroimaging datasets (EEG, fNIRS, and fMRI).
- Better understand brain structural and functional behavior by finding the molecular causes of psychiatric illnesses and mental disorders.
- Acquire multimodal datasets for mental disorders.
- Use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms for the identification of clinical, cognitive, and biological markers in mental health conditions.
- Build precision psychiatry tools for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic treatment prediction for psychiatric and neurologic disorders.
- Apply advanced statistical, artificial intelligence, and machine learning techniques to large Electronic Health Records (EHR), demographic, admission, drug prescription, and claims datasets of patients with mental disorders in my home country, ethically.

## Inspiration
- **ClearStrand-ASD** - The first and only objective laboratory test that can help health care providers rule out autism in children under 4 years (48 months) of age, using a strand of hair.
- **Eko Health** - Catches early signs of heart and lung disease during routine in-person and virtual physical exams through a digital stethoscope.

## Proof of Project
- Build LLM and multimodal foundation models that transform large Electronic Health Records (EHR), demographic, admission, drug prescription, and claims datasets of patients with mental disorders into meaningful insights at the point of care (~2 years).
- Publish papers in JAMA, Nature, and MICCAI.
- Build multiple FDA-approved psychiatric devices for psychiatric care.

## Current Skills
- Extremely proficient in coding in Python and C++.
- Knowledgeable about PyTorch and TensorFlow.
- Clinical support experience in Intellectual Disability and Psychiatric Units in an acute hospital.
- Familiarity with mental health data types and psychiatric assessment tools (DSM-5).
- Very good at writing, conducting research, and reading research papers.
- Very good at building LLM applications, but GPU-poor, so I can't pre-train a powerful model from scratch but can use a base model from Google and Microsoft.

## Skills Needed
- Master graph spectral theory and topological data analysis.
- Brush up on my matrix algebra and frequency analysis knowledge.
- Learn the Geometry Scattering Trajectory Homology (GSTH) for Neuroimaging Data framework.
- Learn how to do medical image analysis.

## Unique Insight from Working
- Activities of daily living are the key to most of these problems.
- 15-minute, 1:1, etc., can be replaced with remote monitoring and probably reduce potential crises.
