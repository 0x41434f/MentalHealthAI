A roadmap to improve the understanding, prediction, and treatment of psychiatric illnesses.

## The Challenge in Modern Psychiatry

Unlike many other fields of medicine, psychiatry currently operates primarily on subjective information, relying heavily on patient self-reporting and clinical observation. There is a significant lack of objective, data-driven metrics to supplement this analysis. By integrating modern tools like neuroimaging, behavioral testing, and advanced algorithms, we can forge a direct link between the brain's mechanics and observable behavior. This would equip medical professionals with the crucial data needed to pinpoint root causes, refine diagnoses, and create tailored, more effective treatment strategies.

Furthermore, the field faces significant hurdles in its research methodologies. Many foundational statistical models and assumptions are inadequate. Designing studies with sufficient statistical power is often constrained by ethical considerations or practical impossibilities. Moreover, findings from animal models frequently fail to generalize to human conditions, and many diagnostic criteria carry unacknowledged cultural biases.

To move forward, we must anchor psychological concepts to tangible neural activity. This approach promises greater scientific rigor and reproducibility compared to relying solely on behavioral observation. The convergence of neuroscience and psychology is essential for progress, as human behavior is too complex to be captured by simple models alone. While both fields are advancing, there is still a vast frontier to explore before we can describe behavior with complete certainty.

## Goals

- Become extremely familiar with mental disorders by studying the DSM-5.
- Become extremely familiar with the biology of the brain and learn how to read neuroimaging datasets (e.g., EEG, fNIRS, and fMRI).
- Better understand brain structural and functional behavior by finding the molecular causes of psychiatric illnesses and mental disorders.
- Acquire multimodal datasets for various mental disorders.
- Use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms for the discovery of clinical, cognitive, and biological markers in mental health conditions.
- Build precision psychiatry tools for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic treatment prediction for psychiatric and neurologic disorders.
- Apply advanced statistical, AI, and ML techniques ethically to large Electronic Health Records (EHR), demographic, admission, drug prescription, and claims datasets of patients with mental disorders in my home country.

## My Research Focus

My work as a mental health worker has shown me just how much data we gather every single day. For each person I support, we track daily activities like eating and showering, vitals like temperature, and detailed behavioral notes. Seeing this wealth of information firsthand has made me curious about how we can use it more effectively. My research ideas are born from this experience.

1.  **Using Everyday Tech to Understand Behavior:** Right now, we rely on asking people how they feel or what they did. This can be subjective and sometimes unreliable. My goal is to build a system that uses simple, everyday sensors to automatically and objectively note a person's daily activities and routines. This tool could help healthcare professionals by spotting small changes in behavior that might be early signs of anxiety or depression. The idea is to provide support before the problems get bigger.

2.  **Creating a Fuller Picture of Brain Health:** The brain is complex, and looking at one type of data, like an MRI scan, only tells part of the story. I plan to combine different kinds of health information to create a more complete view. This includes biological data like genetics, physical data from brain scans, psychological notes on mood, and even environmental information. By connecting these dots, I hope to build a model that gives a clearer picture of brain health and helps create more personalized treatments.

3.  **Developing an AI Assistant for Healthcare Teams:** I've seen how busy healthcare teams can be, which can lead to early signs of mental health struggles being missed. My aim is to create an AI tool that acts as a helpful assistant for these professionals. It would help by reviewing different data sources and flagging individuals who might be showing early signs of depression or anxiety. This tool would not replace a clinician's expertise, but would help them focus their valuable time and skills where they are most needed.

## Inspiration

- **ClearStrand-ASD:** The first and only objective laboratory test that can help healthcare providers rule out autism in children under 4 years (48 months) of age, using a strand of hair.
- **Eko Health:** Catches early signs of heart and lung disease during routine in-person and virtual physical exams through a digital stethoscope.

## Proof of Project

- Build LLM and multimodal foundation models that transform large Electronic Health Records (EHR), demographic, admission, drug prescription, and claims datasets of patients with mental disorders into meaningful insights at the point of care (~2 years).
- Publish papers in prestigious journals such as JAMA, Nature, and MICCAI.
- Build multiple FDA-approved devices for psychiatric care.

## Current Skills

- Clinical support experience in Intellectual Disability and Psychiatric Units in an acute hospital.
- Familiarity with mental health data types and psychiatric assessment tools (DSM-5).
- Strong research and writing skills, with experience reading academic papers.
- Experienced in building LLM applications, with the ability to fine-tune base models from providers like Google and Microsoft, despite limited GPU resources for pre-training from scratch.

## Skills to Acquire

- Master graph spectral theory and topological data analysis.
