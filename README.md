# Project Jatoria
A roadmap to improve my understanding, prediction, and treatment of psychiatric illnesses.

## The Problem
The scale of the mental health crisis is immense. According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), [more than one in five U.S. adults live with a mental illness](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/strategic-planning-reports/challenges-and-opportunities), yet only about [half of them receive treatment](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness). This gap highlights a critical challenge: psychiatry is one of the few medical specialties that still relies heavily on subjective reports and clinician observation alone, with little to no objective data to aid the subjective analysis. Linking brain mechanisms to behavior using algorithms, behavioral testing, and neuroimaging could arm clinicians with vital data to understand causes and to improve diagnosis, resulting in more personalized and effective treatment plans.

The statistics and assumptions underlying much of psychiatry are poor. This challenge is so significant that even in specialized psychiatric centers, misdiagnosis of severe mental illness is common, with one study finding [that nearly 40% of patients were incorrectly diagnosed](https://annals-general-psychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12991-021-00333-7#:~:text=Result,and%20bipolar%20disorder%20(17.78%25).). This is often due to the significant overlap in symptoms between different conditions. Experiments needed to achieve the necessary power are either unethical or impossible. Realistic experiments on other species have the issue of not translating well, or at all, to humans. Many measurements and judgments are culturally specific, without being understood as such.

I believe that grounding certain psychological constructs or ideas in brain activity can instill more confidence than just observing behaviors and drawing conclusions that likely have reproducibility issues. The merging of psychology and brain sciences is the future, given that people are a lot more dynamic than an equation or model can account for. Frankly, psychology and neuroscience, while complementary, still have a long way to go in terms of describing behavior with full confidence.

## Goals
The goal of Project Jatoria is to build tools for the future of psychiatry by combining the best of traditional care with new technologies. My work will focus on the following areas:

- **Find Objective Markers:** Use AI and machine learning to identify reliable biological and behavioral markers for mental health conditions.
- **Build Modern Tools for the Entire Care Team:** Create data-driven tools to help the entire care team from psychiatrists to nurses to technicians with diagnosis, prognosis, and predicting treatment outcomes. A key focus will be on helping differentiate between disorders with overlapping symptoms.
- **Support Primary and Internal Medicine:** Develop methods to help primary care and other medical doctors identify psychiatric issues that may be presenting as physical symptoms.
- **Integrate Treatments:** Explore how data can improve a wide range of treatments, from psychotherapy to modern neuromodulation techniques (like TMS and ketamine).
- **Analyze Health Data Ethically:** Apply advanced statistical and AI techniques to large-scale health records (EHR, prescriptions, etc.) to discover patterns that can improve care, with a strong commitment to ethical guidelines.
- **Master Necessary Skills:** Continuously deepen my knowledge of neuroscience, data analysis, and medical imaging to support these goals.

## Context: The Rise of Precision Psychiatry
Project Jatoria is aligned with a significant and growing movement in the mental health field: **Precision Psychiatry**. This approach seeks to move beyond the current "trial and error" model of treatment by using objective biological and data-driven insights to personalize care. This is not just a theoretical goal; it is actively being built by leading researchers and entrepreneurs.

- **Academic Validation:** At Stanford University, the [Center for Precision Mental Health and Wellness](https://stanmed.stanford.edu/precision-mental-health-promise/), led by Dr. Leanne Williams, is pioneering this effort. Their work uses neuroimaging to identify distinct "biotypes" of depression, which can predict a patient's response to different treatments. This research proves that it is possible to find the objective markers needed to differentiate between conditions with overlapping symptoms.

- **Entrepreneurial Validation:** The commercial world is also recognizing this opportunity. Dr. Amit Etkin, a former Stanford professor, founded [Alto Neuroscience](https://stanforddaily.com/2021/10/31/stanford-professors-startup-redefines-psychiatry-with-biomarkers-artificial-intelligence/), a startup that has raised significant venture capital. He left academia because it was not "agile enough" to support his ambition to build data-driven tools. Alto's mission is to use AI and biomarkers to identify the right patient for the right drug, confirming that there is a strong business case and a critical need for private sector innovation in this space.

These examples show that the core mission of Project Jatoria—to build objective, data-driven tools for mental healthcare—is not just a personal ambition but a key part of the future of psychiatry.

## My Research Focus
My experience, first as a Direct Support Professional (DSP) and now as a Mental Health Worker, has shown me just how much data we gather every single day. For each person I've supported, we tracked daily activities, vitals like temperature, and detailed behavioral notes.

### Using Everyday Tech to Understand Behavior
Right now, we rely on asking people how they feel or what they did. This can be subjective and sometimes unreliable. My goal is to build a system that uses simple, everyday sensors to automatically and objectively note a person's daily activities and routines. This tool could help healthcare professionals by spotting small changes in behavior that might be early signs of anxiety or depression. The idea is to provide support before the problems get bigger.

### Creating a Fuller Picture of Brain Health
The brain is complex, and looking at one type of data, like an MRI scan, only tells part of the story. I plan to combine different kinds of health information to create a more complete view. This includes biological data like genetics, physical data from brain scans, psychological notes on mood, and even environmental information. By connecting these dots, I hope to build a model that gives a clearer picture of brain health and helps create more personalized treatments.

### Developing an AI Assistant for Healthcare Teams
I've seen how busy healthcare teams can be, which can lead to early signs of mental health struggles being missed. My aim is to create an AI tool that acts as a helpful assistant for these professionals. It would help by reviewing different data sources and flagging individuals who might be showing early signs of depression or anxiety. This tool would not replace a clinician's expertise, but would help them focus their valuable time and skills where they are most needed.

This one-year program, starting in October, will provide invaluable mentorship, career development, MCAT preparation, and networking opportunities as I continue my journey toward a career in psychiatry.

## Unique Insight from Working
- Activities of daily living are the key to most of these problems.
- My experience in the DDMI (Developmental Disabilities and Mental Illness) unit confirms that effective care requires integrated mental and behavioral observation, directly connecting my past DSP skills with my current clinical work.
- My clinical work shows firsthand how overlapping symptoms can make diagnosis difficult, confirming the high rates of misdiagnosis seen in research and highlighting the need for more objective tools.
- Most of the patients have multiple co-occurring medical and psychiatric conditions (comorbidities). This validates the focus on Medical Psychiatry and proves that the tools we build must be designed for the complex, real-world patients who need integrated care, not just textbook cases.
- 15-minute, 1:1, etc., can be replaced with remote monitoring and probably reduce potential crises.
