# Project Jatoria
A roadmap to improve my understanding, prediction, and treatment of psychiatric illnesses.

## The Problem
Psychiatry is one of the few medical specialties that relies on the patient’s subjective reports and clinician observation alone, with little to no objective data to aid the subjective analysis. Linking brain mechanisms to behavior using algorithms, behavioral testing, and neuroimaging could arm clinicians with vital data to understand causes and to improve diagnosis, resulting in more personalized and effective treatment plans.

The statistics and assumptions underlying much of psychiatry are poor. Experiments needed to achieve the necessary power are either unethical or impossible. Realistic experiments on other species have the issue of not translating well, or at all, to humans. Many measurements and judgments are culturally specific, without being understood as such.

I believe that grounding certain psychological constructs or ideas in brain activity can instill more confidence than just observing behaviors and drawing conclusions that likely have reproducibility issues. The merging of psychology and brain sciences is the future, given that people are a lot more dynamic than an equation or model can account for. Frankly, psychology and neuroscience, while complementary, still have a long way to go in terms of describing behavior with full confidence.

## Goals
- Become extremely familiar with mental disorders by studying the DSM-5.
- Become extremely familiar with the biology of the brain and learn how to read neuroimaging datasets (EEG, fNIRS, and fMRI).
- Better understand brain structural and functional behavior by finding the molecular causes of psychiatric illnesses and mental disorders.
- Acquire multimodal datasets for mental disorders.
- Use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms for the identification of clinical, cognitive, and biological markers in mental health conditions.
- Build precision psychiatry tools for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic treatment prediction for psychiatric and neurologic disorders.
- Apply advanced statistical, artificial intelligence, and machine learning techniques to large Electronic Health Records (EHR), demographic, admission, drug prescription, and claims datasets of patients with mental disorders in my home country, ethically.

## My Research Focus
My work as a mental health worker has shown me just how much data we gather every single day. For each person I support, we track daily activities like eating and showering, vitals like temperature, and detailed behavioral notes. Seeing this wealth of information firsthand has made me curious about how we can use it more effectively. My research ideas are born from this experience.

### Using Everyday Tech to Understand Behavior
Right now, we rely on asking people how they feel or what they did. This can be subjective and sometimes unreliable. My goal is to build a system that uses simple, everyday sensors to automatically and objectively note a person's daily activities and routines. This tool could help healthcare professionals by spotting small changes in behavior that might be early signs of anxiety or depression. The idea is to provide support before the problems get bigger.

### Creating a Fuller Picture of Brain Health
The brain is complex, and looking at one type of data, like an MRI scan, only tells part of the story. I plan to combine different kinds of health information to create a more complete view. This includes biological data like genetics, physical data from brain scans, psychological notes on mood, and even environmental information. By connecting these dots, I hope to build a model that gives a clearer picture of brain health and helps create more personalized treatments.

### Developing an AI Assistant for Healthcare Teams
I've seen how busy healthcare teams can be, which can lead to early signs of mental health struggles being missed. My aim is to create an AI tool that acts as a helpful assistant for these professionals. It would help by reviewing different data sources and flagging individuals who might be showing early signs of depression or anxiety. This tool would not replace a clinician's expertise, but would help them focus their valuable time and skills where they are most needed.

- **[Eko Health](https://www.ekohealth.com/)** - Catches early signs of heart and lung disease during routine in-person and virtual physical exams through a digital stethoscope.
- **[OnMed](https://www.onmed.com/)** -  A small Clinic-in-a-Box bringing healthcare access anywhere with an outlet to plug it in.
- **[LUMIPULSE G PTAU217/ß-AMYLOID 1-42 PLASMA RATIO](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-blood-test-used-diagnosing-alzheimers-disease)** - An in vitro diagnostic test used to identify patients with amyloid pathology associated with Alzheimer’s Disease who have signs and symptoms of cognitive decline.

## Proof of Project
- Build LLM and multimodal foundation models that transform large Electronic Health Records (EHR), demographic, admission, drug prescription, laboratory tests, clinical, behavioral and cognitive assessments, surveys, and claims datasets of patients with mental disorders into meaningful insights at the point of care (~2 years).
- Publish papers in JAMA, Nature, and MICCAI.
- Build multiple FDA-approved psychiatric devices for psychiatric care.

## Current Skills
- Extremely proficient in coding in Python and C++.
- Knowledgeable about PyTorch and TensorFlow.
- Clinical support experience in Intellectual Disability and Psychiatric Units in an acute hospital.
- Familiarity with mental health data types and psychiatric assessment tools (DSM-5).
- Very good at writing, conducting research, and reading research papers.
- Very good at building LLM applications, but GPU-poor, so I can't pre-train a powerful model from scratch but can use a base model from Google and Microsoft.

## Skills Needed
- Master graph spectral theory and topological data analysis.
- Brush up on my matrix algebra and frequency analysis knowledge.
- Learn the Geometry Scattering Trajectory Homology (GSTH) for Neuroimaging Data framework.
- Learn how to do medical image analysis.

## Unique Insight from Working
- Activities of daily living are the key to most of these problems.
- 15-minute, 1:1, etc., can be replaced with remote monitoring and probably reduce potential crises.
